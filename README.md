# Python-Twitch.com-Lurker
-This was a side project I wrote for fun, after analyzing the twitch.com algorithm to help other streamers get views by pinging their channels on a timed rotation. This benefitted those whose pages I added to my list of available hyperlinks, by not only building them views, but minutes watched as well.
